# Code Refactor Challenge

This is the read me file for the code refactor challenge to simplify and refact the mockup for Horiseon.

The user story is:

"AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines"

The Acceptance criteria is

"GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title"

This is an image for the Design of the Mockup:

The changes I have made to the webpage:

- Changing semantic elements to improve clairity
- Simplified the CSS by using the same class name for matching styles in the HTML
- Added comments to HTML and CSS 
- Added alt tags to all images
- Fixed the missing id tag for items in the nav section
